Introduction

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
It is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.
TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding optional static type annotations, which allow developers to catch
errors at compile-time rather than at runtime. This can help to improve code quality, reduce bugs, and make 
code easier to maintain.
TypeScript also includes several other features, such as interfaces, classes, and modules, which help to 
organize and structure code. It also includes advanced features such as decorators and generics, which can 
be used to write more flexible and reusable code.
TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript code, which can then be executed in any modern web browser or
JavaScript runtime environment. The TypeScript compiler can be configured to target different versions of
ECMAScript, which allows developers to use the latest features of JavaScript while still maintaining 
compatibility with older browsers.
TypeScript is widely used in web development, particularly with the Angular framework. It is also used 
in server-side development with Node.js, and in desktop and mobile application development with frameworks 
such as React Native and Electron.
